## Purpose of HDI calculator

The HDI calculator gives us a framework to understand the influence of different factors on human development.

 Trying different slider input combinations and comparing sample countries is a good way to compare and contrast our perception of what human development means with what is implied by a widely used statistic
 
 HDI calculator is a proof of concept to show how interactivity can bring more life to many economic statistics that are difficult for laymen to grasp without context
